    Terraform Labels
</h1>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 
    This terraform module is designed to generate consistent label names and tags for resources. You can use terraform-labels to implement a strict naming convention.

We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.13](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-lables/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "label" {
          source      = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-labels.git?ref=tags/0.15.0"
          name        = "labels"
          environment = "prod"
          managedby   = "hello@clouddrove.com"
          repository  = "https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-labels"
          label_order = ["name","attributes","environment"]
          delimiter   = "-"
      tags = {
          "Terraform Version"   = "0.15.0"
          "created_date"        = "4-Apr-21"
      }
   }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `name`, `environment` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| extra\_tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. sequence of application name and environment `name`,`environment`,'attribute' [`webserver`,`qa`,`devops`,`public`,] . | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-labels"` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| attributes | Normalized attributes. |
| environment | Normalized environment |
| id | Disambiguated ID. |
| label\_order | Normalized Tag map. |
| name | Normalized name. |
| repository | Terraform current module repo |
| tags | Normalized Tag map. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
